                    <p>
                        The server currently has three beginner teams. They are always on the lookout for players and subs, so if you’re interested, 
                        submit one of our applications (linked further down) and get involved. Being active on the server is the best way for teams 
                        and players to get to know you, and that’s usually the best in.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>New additions to these teams are required to be under 2500 SR to allow them space to grow.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        If you ever manage to get 6 players together, one of who is a willing team captain, contact one of the admins and we can set 
                        up all the channels you need to form your own team! We can also try and hook you up with a coach if required.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The intermediate teams sit directly above the beginner teams and are designed for players whose mechanical skills, game sense 
                        or knowledge of the game has lifted them out of the beginner ranks. Somewhere for the players on the beginner teams to aim for; 
                        these teams are more competitive, and the players are expected to contribute to the improvement of the lower SR players on the 
                        server. This can be done through a wide variety of methods: being a good role model, giving advice, helping with coaching/VOD 
                        reviews, or simply allowing spectators in their scrims.

                    <h2 class="subtitle is-4">VODs</h2>
                    <p>
                        In addition to the teams, there are other ways to improve - VOD reviews, strat theory, shotcalling advice, 1-on-1 coaching 
                        sessions and various server events.
